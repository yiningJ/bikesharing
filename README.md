# bikesharing

## Overview
In order to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, we are doing this project using Tableau to visualize the bike using data that is much easier to read and interact for both stakeholders and investers.

### Purpose
The goal of the project is supporting Tom to collect and report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular votes. Furthermore provide the report the county votes, total vote number for each county, the percentage of votes for each county.

Both male and female are using bikes mainly for communting at around 8am and 5pm during weekdays, not enough data for unknown gender.



##Summary
Trends between female and male are very similar, but males users nearly tripled female users.
The top finding is not surprising that most people are using bikes at communting time during weekdays.
Other two visualizations that I suggest:
- Trips by weekday by birthyear
- Birthyear by usertype
